# Tut-01

## What we're doing

- finding a partner
- making sure you can get on INS
- creating 2 algorithms with your partner
- submitting your 2 algorithms
- getting your first assignment

## finding a partner

Follow this algorithm:

```
If there is someone to your right
  point at that person
Else if there is someone to your left
  point at that person
Else
  stick your hand up in the air

If you are pointing at someone who is pointing at you
  partner with that person and ignore the rest of these instructions
Else if your hand is not up and if there is someone to your left
    point at that person

If you are pointing at someone who is pointing at you
  partner with that person and ignore the rest of these instructions
Else
  stick your hand up in the air

Do the following starting with the front row until there are 1 or 0 people with their hands up
  partner with the person closest behind you with their hand up
```

Sit down so that you are seated next to your partner - you decide how to do this because frankly I'm exhausted from the algorithm.

Log in to your computer.

## making sure you can get on INS

We did this on Thursday, but in case you weren't there, please log into INS.

If you don't know how to do this, ask your partner.

If both you and your partner don't know how to do this, ask another pair.

If you have any issues logging in, call your instructor over.

## creating 2 algorithms

We'll do one together, and then you can create the next two with your partner.

### Sandwich Calorie Calculator

```
Suppose that the following caloric values are fixed:
one slice of bread = 63
one slice of cheese = 106
one Tablespoon of mayonnaise = 49
one pickle = 25
Design an algorithm to ask a user for his lunch order, calculate the total calories in that lunch
and then report the result.
```

## submitting your 2 algorithms

Put your algorithm file into a directory named `tut-01` and submit that directory via the `submit` command.

## getting your first assignment

Going forward, you will always find the starting code for assignments in `/users/library/csis/comp1501/assignments`.

Copy the `1.asg` directory there to your home directory.

Instructions for the assignment are here: https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501/201804.asg.01.documentation
